Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study

## About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic introduced a successful bike-sharing service, which has since expanded to include a fleet of 5,824 bicycles tracked by geolocation technology. The bikes are securely locked at 692 stations throughout Chicago, allowing users to unlock them at one station and return them to any other station within the network at their convenience. Up until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy focused on creating general awareness and appealing to a wide range of consumers. A key factor enabling this success has been the adaptable nature of its pricing plans, including options such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders, who opt for single-ride or full-day passes, and Cyclistic members, who choose annual memberships, comprise the customer base.
